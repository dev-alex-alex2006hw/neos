Neos
====

This software is a computer program whose purpose is to ease execution
of defined sequence of actions on a Slurm cluster. For example, starting
a graphical environment for users, prepare and start a visualization
framework (like Paraview or Salome) for remote use.

Neos features a generic scenario mechanism and can be extended easily
with new scenarios.
